# ZX Ventures / Sempre Em Casa Challenge

## Welcome to Sempre Em Casa!
Every weekend you plan a barbecue to have your friends or family together, so you spend a lot of time at supermarket searching for deals or carrying tons of beers to make sure nobody needs get out to the nearest store if the beer runs out, what if you get help and save some time and money on this routine?

With Sempre em Casa you can automate your drinking routine, choosing the beverages you love to receive when you need it, without bureaucracy or fees! And the price is better or the same you will find in the nearest market store. Cool, right?

We strongly believe everyone deserves to have their drinking routines made easy no matter where, how and when they want it. To fulfill that, we use technology.

## Choose your challenge
So, in order to fulfill this vision and deliver this amazing experience to all our customers, we have an incredible team that is focused to deliver the best experience possible to our users. Working alongside with Product Managers and Designers, our Engineers and Scientists develop and maintain our tech stack, that must be robust, resilient and scalable (and also as simple as possible, right?).

We hope you are eager to take one of our code challenges and show us how amazing you are! We will be cheering for you, good luck!
